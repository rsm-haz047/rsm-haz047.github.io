They sent out over 50,000 fundraising letters to prior donors of a nonprofit organization, randomly assigning recipients to one of several treatment groups.\nThe experiment tested whether the presence of a matching donation offer (e.g., for every $1 donated, the organization receives $2, $3, or $4 total depending on the match ratio) would increase both the likelihood of giving and the amount donated. The matching ratios varied between 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1. In addition, the letters varied the maximum match amount (e.g., $25,000, $50,000, or $100,000) and the suggested donation amount, which was calculated based on each recipient’s highest prior donation.\nRecipients were randomly assigned to treatment groups, making this a clean experimental design for causal inference. The primary outcomes were whether someone donated and how much they gave. These results help inform how nonprofits can design more effective fundraising campaigns.\nThe results were published in the American Economic Review in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the AEA website and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of Harvard’s Dataverse.\nThis project seeks to replicate some of their core findings using the original dataset and statistical methods."

    "text": "Description\nThe dataset includes 50,083 observations, each representing a past donor who received a fundraising letter as part of a large-scale randomized field experiment. The dataset captures a wide range of information, including treatment assignments, donation outcomes, prior giving behavior, and demographic context.\nThere are 51 variables in total, which can be broadly grouped into the following categories: - Treatment indicators: such as treatment, ratio2, ratio3, size25, size50, size100, and askd1, which reflect match ratios, thresholds, and suggested donation amounts. - Outcome variables: including gave (binary indicator for donation) and amount (dollar amount donated). - Historical giving behavior: such as hpa (highest previous amount), ltmedmra (indicator for low prior donors), and years since the first donation. - Demographic and contextual features: such as female, couple, median_hhincome, page18_39, pwhite, and pop_propurban.\nMost variables are either complete or have minimal missingness, and the data types are a mix of binary indicators, integers, floats, and categorical values. This structure makes the dataset well-suited for regression, simulation, and visualization tasks.\nSummary statistics show that approximately 66.7% of observations are in the treatment group, with 33.3% in the control group, as expected from random assignment. The gave variable indicates that about 2.06% of individuals donated, and the average donation (amount) across the full sample is $0.92, with some contributions reaching as high as $400. This reflects the typical skew in donation behavior: most individuals gave nothing, while a few gave large amounts.\nThe match ratio flags (ratio2, ratio3) suggest roughly equal allocation across the 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 groups. Likewise, the match threshold indicators (size25, size50, size100, sizeno) are each present in about 16.7% of the sample. Suggested donation framing variables (askd1, askd2, askd3) also appear to be evenly distributed, reinforcing that the experimental design was properly randomized.\nThe table below provides descriptions for key variables in the dataset.\n#:::: {.callout-note collapse=“true”}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##\nVariable\n\n\n\n\ntreatment\nTreatment\n\n\ncontrol\nControl\n\n\nratio\nMatch

rows × 48 columns\n\n\n\n::::\n\nBalance Test\nAs an ad hoc test of the randomization mechanism, I provide a series of tests that compare aspects of the treatment and control groups to assess whether they are statistically significantly different from one another.\nTo assess whether the treatment was randomly assigned, I examine five pre-treatment covariates unrelated to the outcome: years (years since first donation), female (gender indicator), couple (marital status), median_hhincome (median household income by zip code), and page18_39 (proportion aged 18–39 in the zip code). These are useful for balance testing because they should not be affected by treatment assignment and reflect characteristics likely observed before the intervention.\nFor each variable, I conduct:\n\nA manual t-test, calculated using the following formula:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\bar{X}_{\\text{treatment}} - \\bar{X}_{\\text{control}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s^2_{\\text{treatment}}}{n_{\\text{treatment}}} + \\frac{s^2_{\\text{control}}}{n_{\\text{control}}}}}\n\\]\n\nA linear regression, where the covariate is regressed on the treatment indicator:\n\n\\[\n\\text{covariate}_i = \\alpha + \\beta \\cdot \\text{treatment}_i + \\varepsilon_i\n\\]\nThe coefficient \\(\\beta\\) captures the estimated difference in means between groups.\n\n\n\nManual T-Test Results\n\nyears: The t-statistic was -1.091, indicating no significant difference.\nfemale: The t-statistic was -1.754, just below conventional significance.\ncouple: The t-statistic was -0.582, suggesting no group difference in relationship status.\nmedian_hhincome: The t-statistic was -0.743, showing no income-based imbalance.\npage18_39: The t-statistic was -0.124, indicating age composition is well balanced.\n\n\n\n\nLinear Regression Results\nEach covariate was also regressed on the treatment variable:\n\nyears: Coefficient = -0.058, p = 0.270\nfemale: Coefficient = -0.008, p = 0.079\ncouple: Coefficient = -0.002, p = 0.559\nmedian_hhincome: Coefficient = -157.925, p = 0.458\npage18_39: Coefficient = ~0.000, p = 0.901\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\nAcross all covariates, both the t-tests and linear regressions provide consistent evidence of no statistically significant differences between the treatment and control groups. The estimated coefficients are small, and all p-values exceed 0.05, supporting the assumption of balance under random assignment.\nThese results replicate the purpose of Table 1 in Karlan and List (2007), which provides confidence that the estimated treatment effects are not confounded by observable pre-treatment characteristics."

    "text": "Experimental Results\n\nCharitable Contribution Made\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation.\n\n\nCharitable Contribution Made\nWe examine whether the treatment group had a higher donation rate compared to the control group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart above compares the average donation rates between individuals in the control group and those in the treatment group. The control group received a standard fundraising letter, while the treatment group received a letter that included a matching donation offer.\nAlthough the overall donation rates are low in both groups, the treatment group shows a visibly higher proportion of individuals who donated. This difference, though modest, is consistent with the hypothesis that matching gifts encourage charitable giving. The visual evidence aligns with the statistical results from t-tests and regressions presented later in the analysis, and replicates the main findings of Karlan and List (2007), where even small psychological nudges—like a matching offer—can lead to meaningful behavioral changes.\n\nT-Test for Donation Rates\nThis code performs an independent samples t-test to determine whether the mean donation rate (gave) differs significantly between the treatment and control groups. Since gave is a binary outcome indicating whether a donation was made, the test compares the proportion of donors across the two groups to assess the effect of receiving a matching donation offer.\n\n# T-test on binary outcome (gave)\ntreat = data[data['treatment'] == 1]['gave']\ncontrol = data[data['treatment'] == 0]['gave']\n\nt_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind(treat, control, equal_var=False)\nprint(f\"T-test for 'gave':\\nT-statistic: {t_stat:.3f}, p-value: {p_val:.3f}\")\n\nT-test for 'gave':\nT-statistic: 3.209, p-value: 0.001\n\n\nThe result of the t-test yields a t-statistic of 3.209 with a p-value of 0.001. This indicates a statistically significant difference in donation rates between the treatment and control groups at the 1% significance level. In other words, individuals who received a matching donation offer were significantly more likely to donate than those who did not, supporting the hypothesis that such offers increase giving behavior.\nTo complement the t-test, we estimate a simple ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to evaluate the effect of the treatment assignment on the probability of giving.

The treatment coefficient is 0.0042, with a p-value of 0.002, indicating that assignment to treatment increases the probability of donating by about 0.42 percentage points.\nThe Probit regression also supports this: the coefficient on treatment is 0.0868 (p = 0.002), again showing a positive and statistically significant effect on the likelihood of giving.\n\nOverall, these results replicate the findings in Karlan and List (2007): matching donations increase the probability of giving, even if the actual increase is modest in absolute terms. The consistency across all three statistical approaches (t-test, OLS, and probit) strengthens the causal interpretation of the results. This supports the idea that even small nudges like matching offers can influence donor behavior.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nWe explore whether larger match ratios (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1) result in higher likelihoods of donating compared to a 1:1 match.\n\n\n\nT-tests for Match Ratios\n\n# Filter only treatment group and each match ratio\nratio1 = data[(data['treatment'] == 1) & (data['ratio'] == 1)]['gave']\nratio2 = data[(data['treatment'] == 1) & (data['ratio'] == 2)]['gave']\nratio3 = data[(data['treatment'] == 1) & (data['ratio'] == 3)]['gave']\n\n# T-tests\nprint(\"2:1 vs 1:1\")\nprint(stats.ttest_ind(ratio2, ratio1, equal_var=False))\n\nprint(\"\\n3:1 vs 2:1\")\nprint(stats.ttest_ind(ratio3, ratio2, equal_var=False))\n\n2:1 vs 1:1\nTtestResult(statistic=0.965048975142932, pvalue=0.33453078237183076, df=22225.07770983836)\n\n3:1 vs 2:1\nTtestResult(statistic=0.05011581369764474, pvalue=0.9600305476940865, df=22260.84918918778)\n\n\n\nInterpretation:\nThese t-tests compare donation rates for each match ratio within the treatment group.\n- The 2:1 vs 1:1 test shows a [insert p-value here], and\n- The 3:1 vs 2:1 test shows a [insert p-value here].\nIn both comparisons, the p-values are relatively large, suggesting no statistically significant difference in donation likelihood across match sizes.

These differences are not only small in magnitude but also statistically insignificant based on earlier t-tests and regression outputs.\nThe fact that the raw differences and regression coefficients are nearly identical provides strong evidence that these small effects are consistent across estimation approaches.\nIn line with Karlan and List (2007), we conclude that the presence of a match offer matters, but larger match ratios (like 3:1) do not provide additional benefit over a standard 1:1 match. This supports their interpretation that psychological or motivational factors may be triggered by any match, not necessarily a more generous one.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nNeither the t-tests nor the regression provide strong evidence that increasing the match ratio from 1:1 to 2:1 or 3:1 significantly increases the donation response rate. The estimated differences are small and statistically insignificant. These findings replicate Karlan and List’s claim on page 8 that “larger match ratios do not provide additional lift,” and suggest that announcing any match offer may be sufficient to nudge donation behavior — but increasing the ratio adds little extra power."

In the full sample, the treatment effect is small and only marginally significant. Among those who donated, the estimated effect is negative and clearly not statistically significant.\nBecause the treatment was randomly assigned, the coefficient estimates can be interpreted causally. However, it is important to note that the donor-only model is conditional on post-treatment behavior and may be affected by selection.\nOverall, this analysis supports the main takeaway from Karlan and List (2007): matching offers increase participation (extensive margin), but not the size of contributions (intensive margin).\n\nHistogram of Donation Amounts: Treatment Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram of Donation Amounts: Control Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nIn the regression using the full sample, we find that the treatment group donated $0.15 more on average than the control group. However, this result is not statistically significant (p = 0.063), meaning we cannot rule out that the difference is due to random chance.\nIn the donor-only regression, we isolate just the people who made a donation and ask: do those in the treatment group give more than those in the control? Here, the treatment coefficient is -1.67, again not statistically significant (p = 0.561). In fact, the sign of the effect is slightly negative.\nThe histograms show that donation amounts are heavily skewed, with most donations under $100. The means for treatment and control are both around $45–46, with very similar distributions.\nConclusion: The treatment (i.e., receiving a matching offer) appears to influence whether people give, but not how much they give. The full-sample regression can be interpreted causally because of random assignment, while the donor-only regression cannot, since it conditions on a post-treatment behavior (selection bias).\nOverall, our findings replicate Karlan and List (2007): matching gifts increase response rates, but do not significantly affect the donation size conditional on giving."

However, as we simulate more and more matched pairs (up to 100,000), the cumulative difference stabilizes and converges to the true expected difference of 0.004.\nThis reinforces a key idea in statistics: with large enough sample sizes, the law of averages ensures reliable estimates of population parameters. It also explains why Karlan and List were able to detect small treatment effects — because their experiment had tens of thousands of observations. ```\n\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\nWe simulate distributions of average differences in donation rates between control (p = 0.018) and treatment (p = 0.022) groups, using increasing sample sizes (n = 50, 200, 500, 1000). For each sample size, we repeat the process 1000 times and visualize the distribution of sample differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nThese four histograms illustrate the Central Limit Theorem using simulated sample means of donation rate differences between the treatment (p = 0.022) and control (p = 0.018) groups.\nAs the sample size increases: - With n = 50, the distribution is wide and noisy — there’s considerable variation, and the true mean difference (0.004) is not clearly distinguishable from zero. - At n = 200, the distribution begins to resemble a bell curve, and the true difference is more centered. - At n = 500, the histogram tightens noticeably, and zero begins to lie closer to the tail of the distribution. - By n = 1000, the sample mean differences are tightly clustered around 0.004, and zero is clearly no longer at the center — it lies in the tail, suggesting strong evidence against the null of no effect.\nThis simulation confirms that larger samples reduce sampling variability and make it easier to detect small, true differences — exactly what Karlan and List leveraged with their large-scale experiment."
