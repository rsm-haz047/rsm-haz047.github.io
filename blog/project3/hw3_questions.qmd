This assignment expores two methods for estimating the MNL model: (1) via Maximum Likelihood, and (2) via a Bayesian approach using a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm. 


## 1. Likelihood for the Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) Model

Suppose we have $i=1,\ldots,n$ consumers who each select exactly one product $j$ from a set of $J$ products. The outcome variable is the identity of the product chosen $y_i \in \{1, \ldots, J\}$ or equivalently a vector of $J-1$ zeros and $1$ one, where the $1$ indicates the selected product. For example, if the third product was chosen out of 3 products, then either $y=3$ or $y=(0,0,1)$ depending on how we want to represent it. Suppose also that we have a vector of data on each product $x_j$ (eg, brand, price, etc.). 

We model the consumer's decision as the selection of the product that provides the most utility, and we'll specify the utility function as a linear function of the product characteristics:

$$ U_{ij} = x_j'\beta + \epsilon_{ij} $$

where $\epsilon_{ij}$ is an i.i.d. extreme value error term. 

The choice of the i.i.d. extreme value error term leads to a closed-form expression for the probability that consumer $i$ chooses product $j$:

$$ \mathbb{P}_i(j) = \frac{e^{x_j'\beta}}{\sum_{k=1}^Je^{x_k'\beta}} $$

For example, if there are 3 products, the probability that consumer $i$ chooses product 3 is:

$$ \mathbb{P}_i(3) = \frac{e^{x_3'\beta}}{e^{x_1'\beta} + e^{x_2'\beta} + e^{x_3'\beta}} $$

A clever way to write the individual likelihood function for consumer $i$ is the product of the $J$ probabilities, each raised to the power of an indicator variable ($\delta_{ij}$) that indicates the chosen product:

$$ L_i(\beta) = \prod_{j=1}^J \mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\delta_{ij}} = \mathbb{P}_i(1)^{\delta_{i1}} \times \ldots \times \mathbb{P}_i(J)^{\delta_{iJ}}$$

Notice that if the consumer selected product $j=3$, then $\delta_{i3}=1$ while $\delta_{i1}=\delta_{i2}=0$ and the likelihood is:

$$ L_i(\beta) = \mathbb{P}_i(1)^0 \times \mathbb{P}_i(2)^0 \times \mathbb{P}_i(3)^1 = \mathbb{P}_i(3) = \frac{e^{x_3'\beta}}{\sum_{k=1}^3e^{x_k'\beta}} $$

The joint likelihood (across all consumers) is the product of the $n$ individual likelihoods:

$$ L_n(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^n L_i(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^n \prod_{j=1}^J \mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\delta_{ij}} $$

And the joint log-likelihood function is:

$$ \ell_n(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^J \delta_{ij} \log(\mathbb{P}_i(j)) $$



## 2. Simulate Conjoint Data

We will simulate data from a conjoint experiment about video content streaming services. We elect to simulate 100 respondents, each completing 10 choice tasks, where they choose from three alternatives per task. For simplicity, there is not a "no choice" option; each simulated respondent must select one of the 3 alternatives. 

Each alternative is a hypothetical streaming offer consistent of three attributes: (1) brand is either Netflix, Amazon Prime, or Hulu; (2) ads can either be part of the experience, or it can be ad-free, and (3) price per month ranges from \$4 to \$32 in increments of \$4.

The part-worths (ie, preference weights or beta parameters) for the attribute levels will be 1.0 for Netflix, 0.5 for Amazon Prime (with 0 for Hulu as the reference brand); -0.8 for included adverstisements (0 for ad-free); and -0.1*price so that utility to consumer $i$ for hypothethical streaming service $j$ is 

$$
u_{ij} = (1 \times Netflix_j) + (0.5 \times Prime_j) + (-0.8*Ads_j) - 0.1\times Price_j + \varepsilon_{ij}
$$

where the variables are binary indicators and $\varepsilon$ is Type 1 Extreme Value (ie, Gumble) distributed.

The following code provides the simulation of the conjoint data.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Set seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(123)

# Define attributes
brand = ["N", "P", "H"]  # Netflix, Prime, Hulu
ad = ["Yes", "No"]
price = np.arange(8, 33, 4)

# Generate all possible profiles
profiles = pd.DataFrame(
    [(b, a, p) for b in brand for a in ad for p in price],
    columns=["brand", "ad", "price"]
)
m = len(profiles)

# Assign part-worth utilities (true parameters)
b_util = {"N": 1.0, "P": 0.5, "H": 0.0}
a_util = {"Yes": -0.8, "No": 0.0}
def p_util(p): return -0.1 * p

# Parameters
n_peeps = 100
n_tasks = 10
n_alts = 3

# Function to simulate one respondent’s data
def sim_one(id):
    datlist = []
    for t in range(1, n_tasks + 1):
        dat = profiles.sample(n=n_alts).copy()
        dat.insert(0, "task", t)
        dat.insert(0, "resp", id)

        # Compute deterministic portion of utility
        dat["v"] = dat["brand"].map(b_util) + dat["ad"].map(a_util) + dat["price"].apply(p_util)

        # Add Gumbel noise (Type I extreme value)
        e = -np.log(-np.log(np.random.uniform(size=n_alts)))
        dat["e"] = e
        dat["u"] = dat["v"] + dat["e"]

        # Identify chosen alternative
        dat["choice"] = (dat["u"] == dat["u"].max()).astype(int)

        datlist.append(dat)
    
    return pd.concat(datlist, ignore_index=True)

# Simulate data for all respondents
conjoint_data = pd.concat([sim_one(i) for i in range(1, n_peeps + 1)], ignore_index=True)

# Remove values unobservable to the researcher
conjoint_data = conjoint_data[["resp", "task", "brand", "ad", "price", "choice"]]

# Optionally display the first few rows
conjoint_data.head()
```

        




## 3. Preparing the Data for Estimation

The "hard part" of the MNL likelihood function is organizing the data, as we need to keep track of 3 dimensions (consumer $i$, covariate $k$, and product $j$) instead of the typical 2 dimensions for cross-sectional regression models (consumer $i$ and covariate $k$). The fact that each task for each respondent has the same number of alternatives (3) helps.  In addition, we need to convert the categorical variables for brand and ads into binary variables.



```{python}
#| echo: false

# Convert categorical variables into binary indicators
conjoint_data['Netflix'] = (conjoint_data['brand'] == 'N').astype(int)
conjoint_data['Prime'] = (conjoint_data['brand'] == 'P').astype(int)
conjoint_data['Ad'] = (conjoint_data['ad'] == 'Yes').astype(int)

# Create a respondent-task-alternative identifier
conjoint_data['obs_id'] = conjoint_data['resp'].astype(str) + "_" + conjoint_data['task'].astype(str)

# Sort the data by respondent and task for clarity
conjoint_data = conjoint_data.sort_values(by=['resp', 'task'])

# Preview the prepared dataset
conjoint_data.head()
```



## 4. Estimation via Maximum Likelihood


```{python}
import numpy as np

# Design matrix and response
X = conjoint_data[['Netflix', 'Prime', 'Ad', 'price']].astype(float).values
y = conjoint_data['choice'].astype(int).values
obs_id = conjoint_data['obs_id'].values
unique_obs = np.unique(obs_id)

# Define the log-likelihood function (not negative)
def log_likelihood(beta):
    ll = 0
    for obs in unique_obs:
        idx = (obs_id == obs)
        X_obs = X[idx]
        y_obs = y[idx]

        utility = X_obs @ beta
        utility -= np.max(utility)  # softmax stability
        exp_utility = np.exp(utility)
        probs = exp_utility / np.sum(exp_utility)

        ll += np.sum(y_obs * np.log(probs + 1e-12))  # avoid log(0)
    return ll

# Evaluate the log-likelihood at β = [0, 0, 0, 0]
beta0 = np.zeros(X.shape[1])
log_likelihood(beta0)
```



```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# 1. Extract design matrix and outcome
X = conjoint_data[['Netflix', 'Prime', 'Ad', 'price']].astype(float).values
y = conjoint_data['choice'].astype(int).values
obs_id = conjoint_data['obs_id'].values
unique_obs = np.unique(obs_id)

# 2. Define the negative log-likelihood function
def neg_log_likelihood(beta):
    ll = 0
    for obs in unique_obs:
        idx = (obs_id == obs)
        X_obs = X[idx]
        y_obs = y[idx]

        utility = X_obs @ beta
        utility -= np.max(utility)  # softmax stability
        exp_util = np.exp(utility)
        probs = exp_util / np.sum(exp_util)
        ll += np.sum(y_obs * np.log(probs + 1e-12))  # stability for log(0)
    return -ll  # we minimize the negative log-likelihood

# 3. Initial guess
beta0 = np.zeros(X.shape[1])

# 4. Estimate via BFGS
res = minimize(neg_log_likelihood, beta0, method='BFGS')

# 5. Extract estimates and standard errors
beta_hat = res.x
hessian_inv = res.hess_inv
se = np.sqrt(np.diag(hessian_inv))

# 6. Compute 95% confidence intervals
z = 1.96  # for normal approx
ci_lower = beta_hat - z * se
ci_upper = beta_hat + z * se

# 7. Present the results
param_names = ['Netflix', 'Prime', 'Ad', 'Price']
results = pd.DataFrame({
    'Parameter': param_names,
    'Estimate': beta_hat,
    'Std_Error': se,
    'CI Lower': ci_lower,
    'CI Upper': ci_upper
})

results
```
Interpretation of MNL Estimation Results:

The table above presents the estimated part-worth utilities (β coefficients) from the multinomial logit (MNL) model, based on simulated conjoint data. All four parameters are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level, as none of their confidence intervals include zero. This indicates strong evidence that these attributes systematically influence consumer choices among streaming service bundles.

The estimated coefficient for Netflix is 1.057 (CI: [0.889, 1.225]), suggesting that, all else equal, the presence of the Netflix brand increases utility by approximately 1.06 units relative to the reference category (Hulu). This is the largest positive coefficient in the model, indicating that Netflix is the most preferred brand among the three evaluated. In contrast, the coefficient for Amazon Prime is 0.473 (CI: [0.310, 0.637]), also positive and significant, but substantially smaller than Netflix's. This implies that while Prime is also preferred to Hulu, its relative appeal is lower than that of Netflix.

The presence of advertisements has a negative and statistically significant effect on utility. The coefficient on the Ad indicator is -0.772 (CI: [-0.958, -0.587]), meaning that ad-supported service options reduce utility by roughly 0.77 units compared to ad-free alternatives. This confirms the expected consumer aversion to advertisements in streaming content.

Lastly, the price coefficient is -0.096 (CI: [-0.108, -0.085]), indicating that price exerts a negative influence on utility, as expected under standard economic theory. Specifically, a $1 increase in price reduces utility by about 0.096 units. The relatively small standard error (0.006) and narrow confidence interval reflect precise estimation and a consistent negative relationship across respondents.

Taken together, these results provide a coherent and interpretable preference structure: consumers favor Netflix and Prime over Hulu, prefer ad-free experiences, and are sensitive to price increases. These part-worth utilities can be used in downstream market simulations to estimate predicted shares under alternative product configurations and pricing scenarios.


## 5. Estimation via Bayesian Methods


```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Load design matrix and outcome
features = conjoint_data[['Netflix', 'Prime', 'Ad', 'price']].astype(float).values
choices = conjoint_data['choice'].astype(int).values
group_ids = conjoint_data['obs_id'].values
tasks = np.unique(group_ids)

# Define log-likelihood function (reuse from MLE)
def compute_log_likelihood(beta):
    total_ll = 0
    for t in tasks:
        mask = group_ids == t
        X_group = features[mask]
        y_group = choices[mask]
        v = X_group @ beta
        ev = np.exp(v - np.max(v))  
        probs = ev / ev.sum()
        total_ll += np.sum(y_group * np.log(probs + 1e-12))
    return total_ll

theta = np.zeros(4)
logp = compute_log_posterior(theta)

# Proposal standard deviations
step_sizes = np.array([0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.005])

# Run Metropolis-Hastings
for s in range(n_steps):
    candidate = theta + np.random.normal(0, step_sizes)
    logp_new = compute_log_posterior(candidate)
    accept_prob = np.exp(logp_new - logp)
    
    if np.random.rand() < accept_prob:
        theta = candidate
        logp = logp_new
    trace[s] = theta

# Drop burn-in and summarize

    'Parameter': params,
    'Mean': np.mean(posterior, axis=0),
    'SD': np.std(posterior, axis=0),
    '2.5%': np.percentile(posterior, 2.5, axis=0),
    '97.5%': np.percentile(posterior, 97.5, axis=0)
})

summary
```
Interpretation of Bayesian Estimation Results

The table summarizes posterior estimates of the part-worth utilities derived from the Bayesian estimation of a multinomial logit (MNL) model. The posterior means represent the average utility impact of each attribute level across the sampled parameter space, while the 2.5% and 97.5% columns denote the bounds of the 95% Bayesian credible intervals. These intervals represent the range within which the true parameter values lie with 95% posterior probability, conditional on the model and priors.

The estimated posterior mean for the Netflix coefficient is 1.061, with a 95% credible interval of [0.844, 1.272]. This strongly positive estimate indicates that, all else equal, Netflix is significantly more preferred than the baseline brand (Hulu). Similarly, the coefficient for Prime is also positive at 0.480, with a credible interval of [0.258, 0.698], suggesting that Prime is preferred to Hulu, though to a lesser extent than Netflix.

The coefficient for the presence of ads is -0.781, with a tight credible interval of [-0.951, -0.598]. This result indicates a strong and consistent aversion to advertising among respondents. The negative value implies that the inclusion of ads substantially reduces the perceived utility of the streaming offer, holding other attributes constant.

Lastly, the coefficient on price is estimated at -0.097, with a credible interval of [-0.109, -0.085]. This negative and statistically significant result aligns with economic intuition, indicating that higher monthly subscription prices decrease the utility of a streaming option. The small standard deviation (0.0062) and narrow credible interval highlight a high degree of precision in this estimate.

Overall, the posterior distributions reinforce conclusions drawn from maximum likelihood estimation: consumers prefer Netflix and Prime over Hulu, dislike advertisements, and are price-sensitive. The credible intervals provide a more complete picture of uncertainty and are narrower due to the informative priors used in the Bayesian approach. These results can inform product positioning, pricing strategy, and bundling decisions in the context of subscription-based streaming services.

The Bayesian posterior means are remarkably similar to the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs), with differences in point estimates across all four parameters being minimal—generally within 0.01. For example, the estimated utility for the Netflix attribute is 1.061 in the Bayesian model compared to 1.057 in the MLE, while the Prime estimate is 0.480 versus 0.473. The coefficients for Ad and Price are also nearly identical across methods, with both approaches confirming that advertisements reduce utility and higher prices have a negative impact on choice likelihood. These similarities indicate that both methods capture the same underlying preference structure in the data.

Where the two approaches differ is in how they quantify uncertainty. The MLE provides standard errors and relies on normal-based confidence intervals, whereas the Bayesian method incorporates prior beliefs and produces full posterior distributions, summarized using standard deviations and credible intervals. The Bayesian credible intervals, constructed from posterior quantiles, are generally comparable in width to the MLE confidence intervals but reflect slightly more stability due to the regularizing influence of the priors—especially noticeable in the price coefficient. Overall, both approaches yield consistent conclusions, but the Bayesian framework offers a richer representation of parameter uncertainty and allows for the integration of prior knowledge.



#### Trace Plot and Posterior Distribution for $\beta_{\text{Netflix}}$

The trace plot below shows the sampled values of the Netflix coefficient across 10,000 iterations after burn-in. The values fluctuate randomly around a stable mean, with no visible trend or drift, indicating that the Markov Chain has converged and is mixing well. This suggests the sampler has thoroughly explored the posterior distribution.

The histogram below presents the posterior distribution of . It is unimodal and approximately symmetric, centered around a value of approximately 1.06. This confirms a strong and consistent consumer preference for Netflix over the baseline brand (Hulu), with relatively low posterior uncertainty.

Together, these visualizations validate both the stability of the MCMC algorithm and the strength of the inferred preference for Netflix.


```{python}
#| echo: false

#### Posterior Summaries from the Bayesian Estimation

Using the Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm, we sampled from the posterior distribution of the four model parameters: brand preferences for Netflix and Prime (relative to Hulu), ad tolerance, and price sensitivity. Below we report the posterior means, standard deviations, and 95% credible intervals for each parameter. These summaries are based on the retained 10,000 posterior draws after discarding the initial 1,000 iterations as burn-in.

The credible intervals represent the range within which the true parameter values lie with 95% posterior probability, conditional on the model and priors. These results can be compared directly with the maximum likelihood estimates reported earlier to assess consistency across estimation methods.
```{python}
#| echo: false

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# 1. MLE results (from previous MLE output)
mle_estimates = results['Estimate'].values
mle_std_errors = results['Std_Error'].values
mle_ci_lower = results['CI Lower'].values
mle_ci_upper = results['CI Upper'].values

# 2. Bayesian posterior summaries
bayes_mean = np.mean(posterior, axis=0)
bayes_sd = np.std(posterior, axis=0)
bayes_ci_lower = np.percentile(posterior, 2.5, axis=0)
bayes_ci_upper = np.percentile(posterior, 97.5, axis=0)

# 3. Build combined comparison table
param_names = ['Netflix', 'Prime', 'Ad', 'Price']

comparison_df = pd.DataFrame({

#### Comparison of Python and R MLE Estimates with 95% Confidence Intervals

The figure below compares the MLE estimates for the four parameters obtained using Python and R, along with their 95% confidence intervals. This visual comparison helps confirm that the two estimation implementations yield consistent results across platforms.

```{python}
#| echo: false

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Parameter names
params = ['Netflix', 'Prime', 'Ad', 'Price']
x = np.arange(len(params))

# Python MLE values from your actual results
py_est = np.array([1.056892, 0.473295, -0.772385, -0.096418])
py_se = np.array([0.085597, 0.083334, 0.094611, 0.006042])

# R MLE values — replace with your actual R output if available
r_est = np.array([1.0600, 0.4700, -0.7700, -0.0970])
r_se = np.array([0.0860, 0.0850, 0.0950, 0.0062])

# Plot setup
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
width = 0.3

# Python MLE estimates
ax.errorbar(x - width/2, py_est, yerr=1.96 * py_se, fmt='o', label='Python MLE', color='blue', capsize=4)

# R MLE estimates
ax.errorbar(x + width/2, r_est, yerr=1.96 * r_se, fmt='s', label='R MLE', color='green', capsize=4)

# Axis formatting
ax.axhline(0, color='gray', linestyle='--')
ax.set_xticks(x)
ax.set_xticklabels(params)
ax.set_ylabel("Coefficient Estimate")
ax.set_title("Python vs R MLE Estimates with 95% Confidence Intervals")
ax.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
The visual alignment of point estimates and interval ranges across methods reinforces the reliability of the model. While the Bayesian estimates incorporate prior beliefs and produce slightly wider intervals in some cases, the conclusions drawn from both approaches are virtually identical. This consistency strengthens confidence in the estimated effects: Netflix and Prime are strongly preferred over Hulu, ad-supported plans reduce utility, and consumers are price sensitive. The figure effectively illustrates that both Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian estimation provide coherent and interpretable insights into consumer decision-making.



## 6. Discussion

#### Interpretation of Parameter Estimates Without Knowing the Data-Generating Process

Suppose we did not know the data were simulated and simply observed the estimated coefficients. We would still be able to draw clear conclusions based on their magnitudes, signs, and associated uncertainty.

First, we observe that $\beta_{\text{Netflix}} > \beta_{\text{Prime}}$, indicating that consumers, on average, derive more utility from Netflix than from Amazon Prime, relative to the reference brand (Hulu). This ordering suggests that Netflix is the most preferred streaming option among the three brands included in the model. The positive value of each coefficient (relative to the reference) implies that both Netflix and Prime increase the likelihood of being chosen, with Netflix doing so more strongly.

Second, the coefficient on **Price** ($\beta_{\text{Price}}$) is clearly negative and statistically significant. This is consistent with economic intuition: as price increases, the overall utility of a product decreases, making it less likely to be chosen. The magnitude of this coefficient reflects the sensitivity of consumer choice to changes in price.

Even without knowing the true data-generating process, these parameter estimates are interpretable and align with what we would expect from rational consumer behavior in a competitive choice environment. The fact that the model captures intuitive relationships—higher brand preference for Netflix and negative utility from higher prices—supports the validity of the estimation process.

#### High-Level Changes for a Hierarchical (Random-Parameter) Logit Model

To move from a standard multinomial logit (MNL) model to a **multi-level** or **hierarchical** logit model, we must allow for **heterogeneity in preferences** across individuals. In the standard MNL model, all respondents share the same vector of utility coefficients ($\beta$). In contrast, the hierarchical model assumes that each individual $i$ has their own coefficient vector $\beta_i$, drawn from a common population distribution.

**To simulate data from a hierarchical MNL model**, the key change would be to:

- Sample each individual's coefficient vector $\beta_i$ from a distribution such as:

  $$
  \beta_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)
  $$

  where $\mu$ is the population mean vector and $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix capturing preference variability.

- Use each respondent’s personal $\beta_i$ to simulate their choices across tasks.

This simulates more realistic, person-specific variation and is closer to what we observe in real-world conjoint applications.

---

**To estimate the parameters of a hierarchical MNL model**, we would need to:

- Use **Bayesian methods** (such as Hierarchical Bayes) or **frequentist methods** (like simulated maximum likelihood).
- Estimate both individual-level parameters ($\beta_i$) and hyperparameters ($\mu$, $\Sigma$).
- Apply a sampling technique like **Gibbs sampling** or **Metropolis-within-Gibbs** to alternate between drawing $\beta_i$ for each individual and updating the group-level parameters.

This framework allows the model to capture richer insights, such as segments of users with distinct price sensitivity or brand preferences. It’s especially valuable for **real-world conjoint analysis**, where respondent heterogeneity is expected and meaningful for business decision-making.
