        "The table above presents the estimated part-worth utilities (β coefficients) from the multinomial logit (MNL) model, based on simulated conjoint data. All four parameters are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level, as none of their confidence intervals include zero. This indicates strong evidence that these attributes systematically influence consumer choices among streaming service bundles.\n",
        "\n",
        "The estimated coefficient for Netflix is 1.057 (CI: [0.889, 1.225]), suggesting that, all else equal, the presence of the Netflix brand increases utility by approximately 1.06 units relative to the reference category (Hulu). This is the largest positive coefficient in the model, indicating that Netflix is the most preferred brand among the three evaluated. In contrast, the coefficient for Amazon Prime is 0.473 (CI: [0.310, 0.637]), also positive and significant, but substantially smaller than Netflix's. This implies that while Prime is also preferred to Hulu, its relative appeal is lower than that of Netflix.\n",
        "\n",
        "The presence of advertisements has a negative and statistically significant effect on utility. The coefficient on the Ad indicator is -0.772 (CI: [-0.958, -0.587]), meaning that ad-supported service options reduce utility by roughly 0.77 units compared to ad-free alternatives. This confirms the expected consumer aversion to advertisements in streaming content.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, the price coefficient is -0.096 (CI: [-0.108, -0.085]), indicating that price exerts a negative influence on utility, as expected under standard economic theory. Specifically, a $1 increase in price reduces utility by about 0.096 units. The relatively small standard error (0.006) and narrow confidence interval reflect precise estimation and a consistent negative relationship across respondents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Taken together, these results provide a coherent and interpretable preference structure: consumers favor Netflix and Prime over Hulu, prefer ad-free experiences, and are sensitive to price increases. These part-worth utilities can be used in downstream market simulations to estimate predicted shares under alternative product configurations and pricing scenarios.\n",

        "The table summarizes posterior estimates of the part-worth utilities derived from the Bayesian estimation of a multinomial logit (MNL) model. The posterior means represent the average utility impact of each attribute level across the sampled parameter space, while the 2.5% and 97.5% columns denote the bounds of the 95% Bayesian credible intervals. These intervals represent the range within which the true parameter values lie with 95% posterior probability, conditional on the model and priors.\n",
        "\n",
        "The estimated posterior mean for the Netflix coefficient is 1.061, with a 95% credible interval of [0.844, 1.272]. This strongly positive estimate indicates that, all else equal, Netflix is significantly more preferred than the baseline brand (Hulu). Similarly, the coefficient for Prime is also positive at 0.480, with a credible interval of [0.258, 0.698], suggesting that Prime is preferred to Hulu, though to a lesser extent than Netflix.\n",
        "\n",
        "The coefficient for the presence of ads is -0.781, with a tight credible interval of [-0.951, -0.598]. This result indicates a strong and consistent aversion to advertising among respondents. The negative value implies that the inclusion of ads substantially reduces the perceived utility of the streaming offer, holding other attributes constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, the coefficient on price is estimated at -0.097, with a credible interval of [-0.109, -0.085]. This negative and statistically significant result aligns with economic intuition, indicating that higher monthly subscription prices decrease the utility of a streaming option. The small standard deviation (0.0062) and narrow credible interval highlight a high degree of precision in this estimate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the posterior distributions reinforce conclusions drawn from maximum likelihood estimation: consumers prefer Netflix and Prime over Hulu, dislike advertisements, and are price-sensitive. The credible intervals provide a more complete picture of uncertainty and are narrower due to the informative priors used in the Bayesian approach. These results can inform product positioning, pricing strategy, and bundling decisions in the context of subscription-based streaming services.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Bayesian posterior means are remarkably similar to the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs), with differences in point estimates across all four parameters being minimal—generally within 0.01. For example, the estimated utility for the Netflix attribute is 1.061 in the Bayesian model compared to 1.057 in the MLE, while the Prime estimate is 0.480 versus 0.473. The coefficients for Ad and Price are also nearly identical across methods, with both approaches confirming that advertisements reduce utility and higher prices have a negative impact on choice likelihood. These similarities indicate that both methods capture the same underlying preference structure in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Where the two approaches differ is in how they quantify uncertainty. The MLE provides standard errors and relies on normal-based confidence intervals, whereas the Bayesian method incorporates prior beliefs and produces full posterior distributions, summarized using standard deviations and credible intervals. The Bayesian credible intervals, constructed from posterior quantiles, are generally comparable in width to the MLE confidence intervals but reflect slightly more stability due to the regularizing influence of the priors—especially noticeable in the price coefficient. Overall, both approaches yield consistent conclusions, but the Bayesian framework offers a richer representation of parameter uncertainty and allows for the integration of prior knowledge.\n",

This ordering suggests that Netflix is the most preferred streaming option among the three brands included in the model. The positive value of each coefficient (relative to the reference) implies that both Netflix and Prime increase the likelihood of being chosen, with Netflix doing so more strongly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Second, the coefficient on **Price** (\\( \\beta_\\text{price} \\)) is clearly negative and statistically significant.

The magnitude of this coefficient reflects the sensitivity of consumer choice to changes in price.\n",
